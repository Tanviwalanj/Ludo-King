          <p>Hi, I'm Fahila</p>
          <p>I'm from Ahmdabad, India, and I've done my undergrad in communication design, which was more focused on graphics from Ahmdabad. And after that, I worked for a year as a visual designer, and so I worked on projects like branding, packaging and websites. Now I'm here for sure doing my masters. That's about me. And in general, I love food, I love traveling, and I love being around people.</p>

          <p>So the interface that has an impression on my mind or in my life is the Ludo game. Not the physical one, but the application digital one. Because the reason being, so I have my two nephews and two niece in my house. I'm always around kids and we play a lot of board games and we always used to play Ludo a lot.</p>

          <p>But after the whole COVID thing happened, so in general, like every other family and people, we also had a really hard time in a family during that whole COVID phase. I lost many of my close relatives, so it was a really tough time. And of course, I was not able to meet my friends and family so much at that time because even I had COVID twice when I was isolated for quite some time. So at that time, we downloaded this game, LudoKing, and you can find out Apple and Android, I, like, have a very deep connection with this game because we as family members used to play a lot because you can play it online. So we used to play hours and hours.</p>

          <p>And also, like, my friends group back in India, my school group and also my college group, we also used to play a lot. So I have a very different connection with this game. And to an extent that we also changed our friends, like, group name, like Ludo into Positivity because that game actually gave us so much Positivity. So we have a really deep connection. We also have still kept the name same, but right now we are named as Ludo into Positivity.</p>
